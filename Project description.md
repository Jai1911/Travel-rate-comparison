This project has 2 seperate versions. 
Version 1 has a pre-defined database of about 30 major destinations across India from a defined origin 'Jaipur'.
This version was built only to showcase hwow the designed tool works, by showing the cheapest way to travel to the desired destination from Jaipur. The database was built in MySQL.
version 2 is the main version, which was designed to get the realtime prices of all the available travel options. But this version won't work without a proper api key, which is not wasily available.
We tried to use web-scraping tools and were able to integrate them properly into our code, but web-scapring is prohibited by all major travel booking websites.
